This Commit Contains integration for Google API authentication with fastapi-sso library with correct requirements dependencies.
Next Steps:

1-Check how to resolve JWT to get into the client side without passing jwt, instead use a reference id that points to the server allocated JWT containing the user session data. Consider Redis option or DB.

2-Star implementing generic auth handling for multiple API sso methods (Google/Facebook)

3-Implement different Session token delivery to cross-platform users ((Android/iOS - React Native)/PC - ReactJS)
